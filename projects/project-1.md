What an awesome project this was!

This project consists of the Amazon homepage, which includes a bunch of products which can be added to cart, or removed. The cart adds the total amount of items as well the cost of all items thanks to the react currency format.

This clone also has a working authentication system with a sign in and sign out feature. The sign in (email & password) was super simple thanks to the Firebase configs.

TLDR for tech stack: React.js, React Router, React Context API and React Currency Format with Firebase.

You can view the project live at  [Amazon Clone Website](https://clone-94bcd.web.app/).
